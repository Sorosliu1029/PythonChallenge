# PythonChallenge
Code for practicing python, based on the [PythonChallenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)  
*PythonChallenge*  is an interesting website for **any-level** coder to pratice Python.  
Here I recorded my way to solve the challenge.   
I try to solve on my own, if there is any reference, I will recored it in the *.py file.    

**If you find a better or another way, please feel free to leave a comment. Thanks a lot**

###Detail:
####<a name='warm_up'></a>[Warm Up](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/0.html)
Warm Up game. Just to show the power of Python to calculate big number.  
[Code Here](https://github.com/Sorosliu1029/PythonChallenge/blob/master/PythonChallenge0.py)

####<a name='PC1'></a>[Python Challenge1](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/map.html)
Try to make full use of all the information from the page.  
It's an easy replacement trick. Use string.*maketrans* and string.*translate* function.

####<a name='PC2'></a>[Python Challenge2](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/ocr.html)
Dig deeper into the page, the **whole** page.  
And you will find some secrets in the html file of the page.  
The main task for this challenge is doing some statistics. Here reveals the power of Python in data analysis.

The hint has clearly stated the secret of this challenge.  
Dig into the html source code and there is the key to success.  
First idea came to me is using regular expression and everything is nice. And the page title is 're', so it is obvious. :)  
Regular expression is a powerful tool to deal with string.
